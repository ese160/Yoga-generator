This project is a full-stack application designed to support the creation and management of yoga sequences. It allows users to explore yoga poses, create sequences, and dynamically monitor sessions.

## Project Description

This is a group project by Justice Unanka Eke, Tasbeha Nawaz, and Sarah Peters which is divided into UX design, Frontend, Backend and Deployment

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. `frontend/`: This is where the React application lives. It's built with Vite and uses Material Tailwind for UI components. The main entry point is `src/main.jsx`.

2. `backend/`: This is the PHP backend of the application. It includes several scripts for handling different aspects of the application, such as fetching all yoga poses (`FetchAllYogaPoses.php`), fetching a specific yoga pose by name (`FetchYogaPoses.php`), and more.

## Features

- Allows users registration to the smart accessible Yoga App
- Display the list of all the available yoga poses with descriptions and images
- Allow users to select yoga poses and automatically generate yoga session
